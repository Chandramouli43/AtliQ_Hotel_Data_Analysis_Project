# 📊 AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project Using Python
# 🧩 Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a prominent hotel chain in India, is facing increased competition and declining revenues. To regain its market position, the management has decided to leverage data analytics for insights-driven strategies. Lacking in-house data expertise, they sought external help to uncover trends, identify opportunities, and make informed decisions for customer retention and revenue growth.

🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of hotel operations using Python. By extracting actionable insights from historical booking and revenue data, the project aims to empower AtliQ Grands with data-backed strategies to regain a competitive edge.

🌟 Project Highlights
🧼 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (especially in rating and date columns).

Managed inconsistent date formats and string-based numerical values.

Handled outliers in pricing and revenue data.

🔁 Data Transformation

Added derived columns like occupancy percentage, month-year (mmm yy), and day type (weekday/weekend).

Parsed dates into datetime objects for temporal analysis.

📌 Insights Generation
Answered strategic business questions:

🛏️ Average occupancy rate by room type.

🏙️ Occupancy rates per city.

📅 Weekday vs weekend occupancy trends.

☀️ Occupancy by city in June.
